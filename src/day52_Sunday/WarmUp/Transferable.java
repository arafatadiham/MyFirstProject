/*
 * Warm up Task
 *
 * Create a class called Account
 * it has 2 fields
 *     name as String (protected) , balance as int (private)
 *
 *   -- add constructor to set name and balance
 *   -- add getters to the balance field
 *   -- add deposit method that accept 1 int arugument
 *          -- it will change the balance
 *   -- add withdraw method that accept 1 int arugument
 *          -- reduce the balance
 *   -- add toString method for nice output
 *  Create an interface called Transferable
 *  it has single abstract method
 *      - transferAll accept another Account object as parameter
 *      - void transferAll(Account otherAccount)
 *
 *  Account implements Transferable interface
 *      logic inside transferAll implementation
 *          it should take all the balance from current account to other Account
 *
 *   Create a class called   Account Action with main method
 *      Test your code by creating few Account objects
 *
 *
 *
 *   Optionally : let Account implements Comparable<Account>
 *          Create List<Account> and sort them using Collecions.sort(..)
 *
 *   to honor Palindrome day ,
 *   add a method inside Account class called
 *          isPalindrome return true if account name is palidrome (case and space should not matter)
